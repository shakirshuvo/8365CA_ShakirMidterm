Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Use of appropriate data structure enables a computer system to perform its task more efficiently, by influencing the ability of computer to store and retrieve data from any location in its memory. Different kind of data structures are suited to different computer applications and tasks.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. The possible operations on the linear data structure are: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting and Merging.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. A.	Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System, Statistical analysis package, Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and Simulation.

what is an Array?
A. A.	Array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. •	Implementation of array is simple fixed sized array but Implementation of ArrayList is dynamic sized array.
   •	Array can contain both primitives and objects but ArrayList can contain only object elements.
   •	You can’t use generics along with array but ArrayList allows us to use generics to ensure type safety.
   •	You can use length variable to calculate length of an array but size() method to calculate size of ArrayList.
   •	Array use assignment operator to store elements but ArrayList use add() to insert elements.

what is LinkedList?
A. A.	Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. In Java, LinkedList class implements the list interface.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. A.	Both ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface. However, they differ completely in the way they store and link to the elements. An ArrayList stores the elements sequentially based on their index. However, a LinkedList uses a doubly-linked list to store its elements. A doubly-linked list consists of a collection of nodes, where each node contains three fields: (1) The data at the node, (2) A pointer/reference to the next in the list, (3) A pointer/reference to the previous node in the list.

what is queue?
A. A.	In the Collection framework, LinkedList implements Deque, which in turn extends Queue. Also, PriorityQueue implements Queue. Java Queue interface orders the element in FIFO(First In First Out) manner. In FIFO, first element is removed first and last element is removed at last.

what is stack?
A. A.	A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop. The push operation adds an element at the top of the stack, and the pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack. Java provides a Stack class which models the Stack data structure. Stack is part of the List hierarchy.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. A.	FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last. LIFO is an abbreviation for Last in, first out is same as fist in, last out (FILO).
